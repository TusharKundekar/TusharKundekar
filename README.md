# 💻 Hey there, I'm Tushar Kundekar!

Welcome to my GitHub profile!  
I'm passionate about growing in my career, picking up new tech skills, and making work life a little less overwhelming (and a lot more fun). Here you'll find:

• 🔧 **Projects I'm building or contributing to**  
• 📚 **Things I've learned while juggling work, deadlines, and debugging**  
• 🌱 **Bits of inspiration for anyone trying to survive—and thrive—in the tech world**

Whether you're here to find useful code, get inspired, or just see how someone else is figuring it all out—you're in the right place! 💡

Let's connect, learn, and grow together—one repo at a time.  
You bring the snacks, I'll bring the code 🍕📱
